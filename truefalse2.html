	<h1>1.  Once Obamacare is fully implemented, many more Americans will be getting health insurance directly from the government.</h1>

<dl id="question1">

  <dt>True</dt>
    <dd class="correct"><b>Right!</b>  Starting in 2014, many more Americans will be receiving health insurance through Medicaid, a program funded by both states and the federal government.  Increasing the number of Americans with health insurance was a primary goal of the Obamacare legislation; it sought to accomplish this both by expanding Medicaid and by creating exchanges, or marketplaces, where people could buy private insurance (often with subsidies from the government.)<br/><br/>
    The authors of the Obamacare legislation intended to expand Medicaid so that, starting in 2014, every American with income under 133% of the poverty line would be eligible for Medicaid.  However, a Supreme Court ruling in July 2012 made it possible for state governments to disallow the Medicaid expansions in their states.  Many Republican governors and state legislators have vowed to block the Medicaid expansions in their states.<br/><br/>
    While Congress was debating the legislation that would later become Obamacare, two other plans to expand the number of Americans who receive health insurance directly from the government were considered.  One plan was to allow any American to buy insurance from a "public option", a government insurance program that would compete with private insurance companies in the health care exchanges.  Another plan was to lower the age at which people become eligible for Medi<b><i><u>care</u></i></b>, a government program which mainly provides health insurance for the elderly.  Neither of these plans were part of the final legislation.

<h1>2.  The reason that many conservatives oppose government involvement in the health care market is because they deny that adverse selection is a problem.</h1>

<dl id="question2">

  <dt>True</dt>
    <dd><b>Nope!</b></dd>
    
    <dt>False</dt>
    <dd class="correct"><b>That's it!</b>  In an unregulated market, the people most likely to buy health insurance are those who have, or forsee having, expensive health problems.  People who are in generally good health are less likely to want to buy health insurance.  Since insurane companies cannot stay in business if all their customers need expensive treatments, insurers try to protect themselves by refusing to cover certain medical conditions or groups of people.<br/><br/>
    
    This phenomena is called <b>adverse selection</b> and no one denies that it is a problem.<br/><br/>
    However, liberals and conservatives disagree on how the government should react.  To liberals, the existence of adverse selection is a strong argument for regulating the health insurance market.  According to conservatives like free-market advocate <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Applied-Economics-Thinking-Beyond-Stage/dp/0465003451/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top">Thomas Sowell</a>, the fact that the market has flaws doesn't mean that the government should rush to correct those flaws. "The fact that the government can sometimes improve on the situation that would exist in a free market does not mean that it will in fact restrict its activities to such useful things," he wrote.</dd>

<h1>3.  The reason that many liberals support government involvement in the health care market is because they believe the health care market is just as inefficient as the rest of the economy.</h1>
<dl id="question3">

  <dt>True</dt>
    <dd><b>Incorrect!</b></dd>
    
    <dt>False</dt>
    <dd class="correct"><b>You are correct!</b>  In general, American liberals are capitalists but believe the government should intervene to solve important problems that the free market can't solve.  Most liberals believe that the government ought to play a large and unique role in the health care market, even in comparison to the markets for other basic human needs like food and clothing.  This is because the health insurance market is uniquely inefficient; it suffers from <b>adverse selection</b> and large <b>information disparities between buyers and sellers</b>.</dd>

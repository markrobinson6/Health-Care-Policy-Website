	<h1>1.  Once Obamacare is fully implemented, many more Americans will be getting health insurance directly from the government.</h1>

<dl id="question1">

  <dt>True</dt>
    <dd class="correct"><b>Right!</b>  Starting in 2014, many Americans with income under 133% of the poverty line will receive health insurance through Medicaid, a government program funded by both states and the federal government.<br/><br/>
    
    
    
    <div onClick="openClose('a1')" style="cursor:hand; cursor:pointer"><b><u>Learn why some Americans with income under 133% of the poverty line will not be insured under Medicaid.</u></b></div>
<div id="a1" class="texter">
In July 2012, a Supreme Court ruling made it possible for state governments to disallow the Medicaid expansion in their states.  Many Republican governors and state legislators have decided to block the expansion in their state.
</div><br /><br />
    
    <div onClick="openClose('a2')" style="cursor:hand; cursor:pointer"><b><u>Learn about another way that the Obamacare legislation will increase the number of insured Americans.</u></b></div>
<div id="a2" class="texter">
In addition to expanding Medicaid, the legislation will create exchanges, or regulated marketplaces, where people can buy private insurance (often with government subsidies.)  These exchanges could take the form of websites where people can learn about, and purchase, health insurance.
</div><br /><br />
    <div onClick="openClose('a3')" style="cursor:hand; cursor:pointer"><b><u>Learn about other proposals to provide health insurance directly through the government.</u></b></div>
<div id="a3" class="texter">
Besides the Medicaid expansion, Congress considered two other ways of having the government directly provide health insurance.  Neither proposal was enacted into law.  The first was a "public option", a government insurance program that would compete with private insurance companies.  The other plan was to lower the age at which people become eligible for Medi<b><i><u>care</u></i></b>, a government program which mainly provides health insurance for the elderly.<br/><br/>

Many liberals would like the government to directly provide health insurance for all Americans; this is called a "single-payer" system.
</div>
    
    
    
</dd>
    
    <dt>False</dt>
    <dd><b>Sorry!</b></dd>
    
   
</dl>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>2.  In general, liberals think that "adverse selection" is a problem but conservatives do not.</h1>

<dl id="question2">

  <dt>True</dt>
    <dd><b>Nope!</b></dd>
    <dt>False</dt>
    <dd class="correct"><b>That's it!</b>  In fact, everyone agrees that adverse selection is a market failure; its existence is not controversial.<br/><br/>
    
    Because of adverse selection, many liberals argue that the government should directly provide health insurance and/or heavily regulate private insurers.  Many conservatives argue that government will make things worse.<br/><br/>
	
	<div onClick="openClose('a4')" style="cursor:hand; cursor:pointer"><b><u>Learn about adverse selection.</u></b></div>
<div id="a4" class="texter">
In an unregulated market, the people most likely to buy health insurance are those who have, or forsee having, expensive health problems.  People who are in generally good health are less likely to want to buy health insurance.  This is called "adverse selection".<br/><br/>

Since insurance companies cannot stay in business if all their customers need expensive treatments, insurers try to protect themselves by refusing to cover certain medical conditions, or certain groups of people.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>3.  Many liberals believe the health care market is just as inefficient as the rest of the economy.</h1>
<dl id="question3">

  <dt>True</dt>
    <dd><b>Incorrect!</b></dd>
    
    <dt>False</dt>
    <dd class="correct"><b>You are correct!</b>  The health care market is considered to be significantly more inefficient than most other parts of the economy.  This is because the health care sector is plagued by market failures such as <i>adverse selection</i> and <i>information disparities between buyers and sellers</i>.<br/><br/>
    That's why many liberals, who support capitalism and free markets in many other economic sectors, believe the government ought to play a large and unique role in the health care market.

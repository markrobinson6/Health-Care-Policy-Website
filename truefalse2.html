	<h1>1.  Once Obamacare is fully implemented, many more Americans will be getting health insurance directly from the government.</h1>

<dl id="question1">

  <dt>True</dt>
    <dd class="correct"><b>Right!</b>  Starting in 2014, many Americans with income under 133% of the poverty line (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.familiesusa.org/resources/tools-for-advocates/guides/federal-poverty-guidelines.html">$31,322 for a family of four, in 2013 dollars</a>) will receive health insurance through Medicaid, a government program funded by both states and the federal government.<br/><br/>
    
    
    
    <div onClick="openClose('a1')" style="cursor:hand; cursor:pointer"><b><u>Learn why some Americans with income under 133% of the poverty line will not be insured under Medicaid.</u></b></div>
<div id="a1" class="texter">
The authors of Obamacare intended for all Americans under 133% of the poverty line to be eligible for Medicaid.  However, in July 2012, a Supreme Court ruling made it possible for state governments to disallow the Medicaid expansion in their states.  Many Republican governors and state legislators have decided to block the expansion in their state.
</div><br /><br />
    
    <div onClick="openClose('a2')" style="cursor:hand; cursor:pointer"><b><u>Learn about another way that the Obamacare legislation will increase the number of insured Americans.</u></b></div>
<div id="a2" class="texter">
In addition to expanding Medicaid, the legislation will create exchanges, or regulated marketplaces, where people can buy private insurance (often with government subsidies.)  These exchanges could take the form of websites where people can learn about, and purchase, health insurance.
</div><br /><br />
    <div onClick="openClose('a3')" style="cursor:hand; cursor:pointer"><b><u>Learn about other proposals to provide health insurance directly through the government.</u></b></div>
<div id="a3" class="texter">
Besides the Medicaid expansion, Congress considered two other ways of having the government directly provide health insurance.  Neither proposal was enacted in the Obamacare law.  The first was a "public option", a government insurance program that would compete with private insurance companies.  The other plan was to lower the age at which people become eligible for Medi<b><i><u>care</u></i></b>, a government program which mainly provides health insurance for the elderly.<br/><br/>

Many liberals would like the government to directly provide health insurance for all Americans; this is called a "single-payer" system.

    <dt>False</dt>
    <dd><b>Sorry!</b></dd>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>2.  When people have insurance that covers the cost of medical care, they are more likely to use medical care without worrying about how much it costs.  This phenomenon is called "adverse selection."</h1>

<dl id="question2">

  <dt>True</dt>
    <dd><b>Nope!</b></dd>
    <dt>False</dt>
    <dd class="correct"><b>That's it!</b>  In fact, that phenomenon is called "moral hazard", not "adverse selection".  Adverse selection is something else.</b><br/><br/>
	
	<div onClick="openClose('a4')" style="cursor:hand; cursor:pointer"><b><u>Learn about adverse selection.</u></b></div>
<div id="a4" class="texter">
In an unregulated market, the people most likely to buy health insurance are those who have, or forsee having, expensive health problems.  If you expect only to have $100 worth of health expenses during the upcoming year, you probably wouldn't want to spend $3,000 on a health insurance policy, unless you are very risk-averse.<br/>
<br/>
So, imagine that an insurance company sells a policy for $3,000 per year.  Many people who buy that policy would be people who expect to have $3,000 of health expenses or more.  Thus, in order to avoid losing money, the insurer must raise prices.  But if it raises the price - let's say to $4,000, for example - then many people who were willing to buy at $3,000 will refuse to buy at $4,000.  Once again, the insurer is stuck with a pool of customers who will cost it money.<br/>
<br/>
This can cause a cycle of rising prices; it may get so extreme that the insurance company decides not to sell the policy at all.  To "solve" this problem, insurance companies try to get more information about the health of potential customers.  Once they have this information, they can refuse to sell insurance to those who they think will cost them too much money (or, they sell policies with severe limitations.)  Although this solves the cycle of rising prices associated with adverse selection, it has a great cost to society: specifically, many older people or people with pre-existing conditions - those who need insurance most - are unable to get insured!

<h1>3.  Many liberals argue that the government ought to play a large role in health care because the health care market is uniquely inefficient.  Many conservatives argue that when the government tries to solve problems in the health care market, it makes things worse.</h1>
<dl id="question3">

  <dt>True</dt>
    <dd class="correct"><b>You are correct!</b>  The health care market is considered to be significantly more inefficient than most other parts of the economy.  This is because the health care sector is plagued by market failures such as <i>adverse selection</i> and <i>information disparities between buyers and sellers</i>.<br/><br/>
    That's why many liberals, who support capitalism and free markets in many other economic sectors, believe the government ought to play a large and unique role in the health care market.<br/>
    <br/>
    Although many conservatives acknowledge that the health care market has flaws, they argue that attempts to solve them with government may lead to "government failure" that is worse than "market failure".  This is because politicians often have perverse incentives; for example, politicians may be more interested in winning elections and appeasing special interests than doing what is in the public's general interest.

	<h1>1.  Once Obamacare is fully implemented, many more Americans will be getting health insurance directly from the government.</h1>

<dl id="question1">

  <dt>True</dt>
    <dd class="correct"><b>Right!</b>  Obamacare will allow everyone who makes incomes up to 133% of the poverty line to get insurance through Medicaid. <br/><br/>

Before Obamacare was passed, other plans to expand government insurance coverage were considered: specifically, a plan to lower the age for which people are eligible for Medicare, and a plan to allow anyone to buy into a “public option”, which would be a public insurance program that would compete with private plans.  Those two ideas weren't enacted, but the Medicaid expansion was.  (Note, however, that the Supreme Court ruling allowed state governments to decline federal Medicaid fundings, so low-income people in certain states may not get coverage through Medicaid.  Many Republican governors have vowed not to accept the funds.)

    <dt>False</dt>
    <dd>Sorry!</dd>
    
   
</dl>

<h1>2.  Many conservatives argue that the government shouldn't intervene in the health care market because they deny the existence of adverse selection.</h1>

<dl id="question2">

  <dt>True</dt>
    <dd>Nope!</dd>
    
    <dt>False.</dt>
    <dd class="correct">That's it!  Adverse selection is a basic economic concept whose existence is acknowledged by all economists. However, liberals and conservatives disagree on how the government should respond to adverse selection. According to free-market advocate Thomas Sowell, the fact that the market has flaws doesn't mean that the government should rush to correct those flaws. "The fact that the government can sometimes improve on the situation that would exist in a free market does not mean that is will in fact restrict its activities to such useful things," he says.</dd>

<h1>3.  Many liberals argue that the government should intervene in the health care market because it has the same inefficiencies that can be found in other parts of the economy.</h1>
<dl id="question3">

  <dt>True</dt>
    <dd>Yup!  Market competition has caused amazing advances in technology, food production, and many other fields.  Many free-market advocates believe that competition can have a similar effect in medicine and health care...so long as government gets out of the way.</dd>
    
    <dt>False</dt>
    <dd class="correct">Sorry!  In an ideal world, a democratically-elected government will do whatever is best for the general public.  In the real world, politicians are often bought off by special interests.  Conservatives believe this problem can be minimized by reducing the areas in which government is involved.</dd>

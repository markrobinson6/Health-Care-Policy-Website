	<h1>1.  One of Obamacare's major goals is to increase the number of Americans with insurance.  Starting in 2014, which of the following is a method that the legislation will use?</h1>
	<dl id="question1">
		<dt>All Americans with incomes below 133% of the federal poverty line will be eligible for Medicare.</dt>
		<dd ><b>Incorrect!</b>  Under Obamacare, many Americans with income below 133% of the federal poverty line can be eligible for Medi<b><u><i>caid</i></u></b>, not Medicare.<br/><br/>
			<div onClick="openClose('a1')" style="cursor:hand; cursor:pointer"><b><u>Learn why some Americans with income under 133% of the poverty line will not be insured under Medicaid.</u></b></div>
			<div id="a1" class="texter">
The authors of Obamacare intended for all Americans under 133% of the poverty line to be eligible for Medicaid.  However, in July 2012, a Supreme Court ruling made it possible for state governments to disallow the Medicaid expansion in their states.  Many Republican governors and state legislators have decided to block the expansion in their state.</div>
		</dd>
	
    <dt class="correct">Exchanges will be set up at which individual Americans can buy private insurance that has been rated "White Belt", "Green Belt", "Blue Belt", or "Black Belt."</dt>
    <dd><b>Nope!</b>  The plans will be rated "bronze", "silver", "gold", or "platinum."<br/><br/>
	
	Exchanges, or marketplaces, will be set up at which Americans can buy insurance (for example, by going to a website).  The plans will be given these ratings to make it easier for people to compare plans before purchasing them.</dd>
    
    <dt>Some Americans will be eligible to buy private insurance with subsidies from the federal government.</dt>
    <dd class="correct"><b>That's it!</b>  In 2010 dollars, any family of four with income up to $88,200 will be eligible for federal subsidies when buying private insurance.<br/><br/>
    
    Note that some low-income families won't need subsidies to buy private insurance.  A family of four with income below 133% of the federal proverty line - which is $29,327 in 2010 dollars - will be eligible for Medicaid and so won't need to buy private insurance.</dd>
    
    <dt>Health care exchanges will have a "public option" which will allow people to buy insurance directly from the government rather than through private insurers.</dt>
    <dd><b>Sorry!</b>  A public option was included in early drafts of the legislation, but it didn't receive enough Congressional support.</dd>

<h1>2.  Obamacare's plan to expand insurance coverage is often described as a "three-legged stool" because all three elements of the stool are needed for the whole thing to work.<br/><br/>Which of the following is NOT one of the legs of the stool?</h1>
<dl id="question2">

  <dt>Prohibiting insurers from charging higher premiums or denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions</dt>
    <dd><b>Sorry!</b>  In fact, this <i>is</i> one leg of the three-legged stool.<br/><br/>
    <div onClick="openClose('a2')" style="cursor:hand; cursor:pointer"><b><u>Learn why this leg is part of the three-legged stool.</u></b></div>
			<div id="a2" class="texter">
Allowing more Americans to get insurance - regardless of their health status - is one of the major goals of Obamacare.</div>
    
    
    </dd>
  
  <dt>An individual mandate to buy insurance.</dt>
    <dd><b>Sorry!</b>  In fact, this <i>is</i> one leg of the three-legged stool.<br/><br/>
    <div onClick="openClose('a3')" style="cursor:hand; cursor:pointer"><b><u>Learn why this leg is part of the three-legged stool.</u></b></div>
			<div id="a3" class="texter">
To understand why this leg was added, remember that Obamacare will prohibit insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.  Though this will help a lot of people, it can also cause the following problem: once everyone knows that they can buy insurance whenever they want, there is no incentive for healthy people to buy insurance...after all, they can just wait until they get sick and buy insurance then!<br/><br/>
	In order to avoid bankruptcy, insurers need healthy people to buy insurance.  If too many customers are sick, then an insurer will run out of money.  (Healthy people give the insurer money when they pay premiums.  Sick people must pay premiums too, but they often make expensive claims which cost the insurer money.) <br/><br/>
	So, in order to ensure that healthy people don't stop buying insurance, the legislation compels almost everyone to either have insurance or pay a tax, starting in 2014.

    <dt>Independent Payment Advisory Board.</dt>
    <dd class="correct"><b>That's it!</b>  This board is part of the Obamacare legislation's effort to control costs.  However, it is not part of the effort to expand coverage, and not part of the three-legged stool.</dd>
    
    <dt>Providing financial assistance.</dt>
    
	
	<dd><b>Sorry!</b>  In fact, this <i>is</i> one leg of the three-legged stool.<br/><br/>
    <div onClick="openClose('a4')" style="cursor:hand; cursor:pointer"><b><u>Learn why this leg is part of the three-legged stool.</u></b></div>
			<div id="a4" class="texter">
To understand why this leg was added, remember that Obamacare contains an <i>individual mandate</i> which compels almost everyone to buy insurance.  It is widely considered unfair to force people to buy something they can't afford; therefore the legislation contains financial assistance to help low-income people buy insurance (and some people are exempt from the mandate altogether.)<br/><br/>

<h1>3.  Many of Obamacare's major provisions are set to come into effect in 2014.  Do you think Obamacare will be successful?
</h1>
<dl id="question3">

  <dt >Obamacare will be a huge disaster; the government should stay out of the health care market!</dt>
    <dd class="correct"><b>Perhaps!</b>  Hopefully, America is not about to experience a nightmare of greedy special interests, ineffective beaurocrats, corruption, poor planning, black markets, waiting lines, rising prices, unclean hospitals, overworked doctors, and soaring deficits.</dd>
  
  <dt >Obamacare will be a huge disaster; Obama should have pushed for a single-payer system, or at least he should have fought harder for a public option in the exchanges.</dt>
    <dd class="correct"><b>Perhaps!</b>  Hopefully, America is not about to experience a nightmare in which poor, overworked citizens are forced to buy insurance from greedy, private insurers who continue to hassle them and deny them care, all while prices continue to soar higher and higher.</dd>
    
    <dt >Obamacare will be excellent!</dt>
    <dd class="correct"><b>Perhaps!</b>  Hopefully, millions of Americans will now have access to the care they need without facing life-altering medical bills.  Obama pledged not to disrupt those who are happy with their current coverage, but if Obamacare works well, perhaps the employer-based system will end voluntarily as millions flock to buy insurance individually in well-run, well-financed health care exchanges.</dd>
    
    
    
    <dt>Obamacare has the potential to be the start of something great, but it may also flop.</dt>
    <dd class="correct"><b>Perhaps!</b>  Arguably, Obamacare is based on sound economics.  But what about its politics?  It will be difficult for such a major piece of legislation to succeed with so many Americans, and virtually the entire Republican party, dead set against it.  One danger is that the legislation will be significantly altered, repealed, or underfunded before its major provisions come into effect in 2014.  Another is that officials at the federal or state level will refuse to carry out and enforce the law.<br/><br/>
    Furthermore, even if Obamacare is generally based on sound economics, it still may need some adjustments, perhaps fairly major adjustments.  Will the political system be responsive enough to ensure Obamacare's success?
    </dd>
    
    <dt>My opinion is too nuanced to be described in a single sentence.</dt>
    <dd class="correct"><b>Good for you!</b>  A complicated issue like health care policy deserves more than a soundbite.

	<h1>1.  One of Obamacare's major goals is to increase the number of Americans with insurance.  Which of the following is a method that the legislation will use to increase the number of Americans with insurance?</h1>
<dl id="question1">

  <dt>All Americans with incomes below 133% of the federal poverty line will be eligible for Medicare.</dt>
    <dd  ><b>Incorrect!</b>  Under Obamacare, all Americans with income below 133% of the federal poverty line can be eligible for Medi<b><u><i>caid</i></u></b>, not Medicare.  However, following the Supreme Court ruling in July 2012, states are able to decline this expansion of Medicaid.  So, there may still be some Americans with incomes below 133% of the poverty line that will not have insurance coverage.</dd>
    
    <dt class="correct">Exchanges will be set up at which individual Americans can buy private insurance that has been rated "White Belt", "Green Belt", "Blue Belt", or "Black Belt."</dt>
    <dd><b>Nope!</b>  Exchanges, or marketplaces, will be set up at which Americans can buy insurance (for example, by going to a website).  In order to make it easier for people to compare plans, each insurance plan will be rated "bronze", "silver", "gold", or "platinum."  </dd>
    
    <dt>Some Americans will be eligible to buy private insurance with subsidies from the federal government.</dt>
    <dd class="correct"><b>That's it!</b>  In 2010 dollars, any family of four making up to $88,200 will be eligible for federal subsidies when buying private insurance.  But those making under 133% of the federal proverty line - which is $29,327 in 2010 dollars for a family of four - would be eligible for Medicaid and so wouldn't need to buy private insurance.</dd>
    
    <dt>Health care exchanges will have a "public option" which will allow people to buy insurance directly from the government rather than through private insurers.</dt>
    <dd><b>Sorry!</b>  A public option was included in early drafts of the legislation but it was removed because there were not enough votes in Congress to pass the legislation with a public option.  The final legislation does include an expansion of government health care - the expansion of Medicaid to everyone under 133% of the poverty line - but those who do not qualify for Medicaid or other government programs will continue to have no option except private insurance.</dd>

<h1>2.  Obamacare's plan to expand insurance coverage is often described as a "three-legged stool" because all three elements of the stool are needed for the whole thing to work.<br/><br/>Which of the following is NOT one of the legs of the stool?</h1>
<dl id="question2">

  <dt >Prohibiting insurers from charging higher premiums or denying coverage to people due to their health status or pre-existing conditions</dt>
    <dd><b>Sorry!</b>  In fact, this <i>is</i> one leg of the three-legged stool.<br/><br/>  This is possibly the most popular part of Obamacare, and one of the major goals of the legislation.</dd>
  
  <dt>An individual mandate to buy insurance.</dt>
    <dd><b>Sorry!</b>  In fact, this <i>is</i> one leg of the three-legged stool.<br/><br/>
    
    To understand why this leg was added, remember that Obamacare will prohibit insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.  It is feared that healthy people will have no incentive to buy insurance, since they could just wait until they are sick and buy insurance then.  This would cause the insurance system to collapse, because insurers can't stay in business if the only people buying insurance are people making expensive claims.<br/><br/>
    
    Therefore, the legislation contains a mandate.  In other words, it compels almost everyone to buy insurance.  Starting in 2014, most people will be required to either have insurance or pay a tax.
    </dd>
    
    
    
    <dt>Medicare payment advisory board.</dt>
    <dd class="correct"><b>That's it!</b>  The Medicare board is part of the Obamacare legislation's effort to control costs.  However, it is not part of the effort to expand coverage, and not part of the three-legged stool.</dd>
    
    <dt>Providing financial assistance.</dt>
    <dd><b>Sorry!</b>  In fact, this <i>is</i> one leg of the three-legged stool.<br/><br/>
	
	Since Obamacare contains an individual mandate to buy insurance, it was decided that the law must provide financial assistance for those who can't afford to buy insurance.  Forcing relatively low-income people to buy insurance, without financial assistance, would cause them great hardship.</dd>

<h1>3.  Many of Obamacare's major provisions are set to come into effect in 2014.  Do you think Obamacare will be successful?
</h1>
<dl id="question3">

  <dt >Obamacare will be a huge disaster; the government should stay out of the health care market!</dt>
    <dd class="correct"><b>Perhaps!</b>  Hopefully, America is not about to experience a nightmare of greedy special interests, ineffective beaurocrats, corruption, poor planning, black markets, waiting lines, rising prices, unclean hospitals, overworked doctors, and soaring deficits.</dd>
  
  <dt >Obamacare will be a huge disaster; Obama should have pushed for a single-payer system, or at least he should have fought harder for a public option in the exchanges.</dt>
    <dd class="correct"><b>Perhaps!</b>  Hopefully, America is not about to experience a nightmare in which poor, overworked citizens are forced to buy insurance from greedy, private insurers who continue to hassle them and deny them care, all while prices continue to soar higher and higher.</dd>
    
    <dt >Obamacare will be excellent!</dt>
    <dd class="correct"><b>Perhaps!</b>  Hopefully, millions of Americans will now have access to the care they need without facing life-altering medical bills.  Obama pledged not to disrupt those who are happy with their current coverage, but if Obamacare works well, perhaps the employer-based system will end voluntarily as millions flock to buy insurance individually in well-run, well-financed health care exchanges.</dd>
    
    
    
    <dt>Obamacare has the potential to be the start of something great, but it may also flop.</dt>
    <dd class="correct"><b>Perhaps!</b>  Arguably, Obamacare is based on sound economics.  But what about its politics?  It will be difficult for such a major piece of legislation to succeed with so many Americans, and virtually the entire Republican party, dead set against it.  One danger is that the legislation will be significantly altered, repealed, or underfunded before its major provisions come into effect in 2014.  Another is that officials at the federal or state level will refuse to carry out and enforce the law.<br/><br/>
    Furthermore, even if Obamacare is generally based on sound economics, it still may need some adjustments, perhaps fairly major adjustments.  Will the political system be responsive enough to ensure Obamacare's success?
    </dd>
    
    <dt>My opinion is too nuanced to be described in a single sentence.</dt>
    <dd class="correct"><b>Good for you!</b>  A complicated issue like health care policy deserves more than a soundbite.
